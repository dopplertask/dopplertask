<h1>DopplerTask - Task Automation</h1>

DopplerTask is a revolutionary open-source software that allows you to easily automate tasks. Whether itâ€™s a bunch of bash scripts or just starting your car remotely, you can automate it. Build, run, reuse and share automations with anyone around the globe.

On top of all of this life-simplifying project, we are striving to make an climate friendly software that is fast, easy and consumes as little resources as possible.

## Usage

### Example
#### Add a task

Below is an example json of a Task:
```
{
  "name": "task_ya0mh2aw9j9n8tyux4fjhj",
  "description": "",
  "parameters": [],
  "actions": [
    {
      "@type": "StartAction",
      "ports": [
        {
          "externalId": "89741e7c-c0f2-2feb-3be5-42cb60c5ff4e",
          "portType": "OUTPUT"
        }
      ],
      "guiXPos": 50,
      "guiYPos": 340
    },
    {
      "@type": "PrintAction",
      "continueOnFailure": "",
      "scriptLanguage": "VELOCITY",
      "retries": "0",
      "failOn": "",
      "message": "Hello world",
      "ports": [
        {
          "externalId": "a4cc77f7-7a1c-d718-09c0-3cd3b01765b3",

      },
      "target": {
        "externalId": "a4cc77f7-7a1c-d718-09c0-3cd3b01765b3"

```

This file is used to add tasks to the system. You can do that by sending a request to the REST API:

```curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/task -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @add_task.json```

#### Run a task

To run a task, send the JSON with the task id and parameters to the REST API:

```
{
  "taskName": "doppler-example",
  "parameters": {
  }
}
```

Example of the call:

```curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/schedule/task -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @run_task.json```

### Task parameters
Task paramters are used to indicate what initial variables are needed to run a task.
They can be either required or not required, and can also have a default value.

All task parameters are put into the $parameters variable (see Important Variables).

To add task parameters manually using JSON:
```
"parameters": [
    {"name": "testVar", "description": "This is just a test var", "required": true, "defaultValue": "testasdasdasas"}
  ],
```

## Contribution
If you would like to contribute to this project, you can create pull requests, open issues and features and join discussions.
Our mission is to great open-source software to everyone.
The basic node in each task is an action. Our focus will be partially on improving the software and the other part will be to expand the library of actions.
